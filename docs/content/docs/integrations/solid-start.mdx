Before you start, make sure you have a Better Query instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to SolidStart server. Put the following code in your `*query.ts` file inside `/routes/api/query` folder.

```ts title="*query.ts"
import { query } from "~/lib/query";
import { toSolidStartHandler } from "better-query/solid-start";

export const { GET, POST } = toSolidStartHandler(query);
```
