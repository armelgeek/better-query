Better Query comes with a built-in CLI to help you manage the database schemas, initialize your project, generate resource schemas, and gather diagnostic information about your setup.

## Generate

The `generate` command creates the schema required by Better Query based on your resource definitions. If you're using a database adapter like Prisma or Drizzle, this command will generate the right schema for your ORM. If you're using the built-in Kysely adapter, it will generate an SQL file you can run directly on your database.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx better-query generate
```

### Options

- `--output` - Where to save the generated schema. For Prisma, it will be saved in prisma/schema.prisma. For Drizzle, it goes to schema.ts in your project root. For Kysely, it's an SQL file saved as schema.sql in your project root.
- `--config` - The path to your Better Query config file. By default, the CLI will search for a query.ts file in **./**, **./utils**, **./lib**, or any of these directories under the `src` directory.
- `--yes` - Skip the confirmation prompt and generate the schema directly.


## Migrate

The migrate command applies the Better Query schema directly to your database. This is available if you're using the built-in Kysely adapter. For other adapters, you'll need to apply the schema using your ORM's migration tool.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx better-query migrate
```

### Options

- `--config` - The path to your Better Query config file. By default, the CLI will search for a query.ts file in **./**, **./utils**, **./lib**, or any of these directories under the `src` directory.
- `--yes` - Skip the confirmation prompt and apply the schema directly.

## Init

The `init` command allows you to initialize Better Query in your project.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx better-query init
```

### Options

- `--name` - The name of your application. (defaults to the `name` property in your `package.json`).
- `--framework` - The framework your codebase is using. Currently supported frameworks include `Next.js`, `Nuxt`, `SvelteKit`, and more.
- `--plugins` - The plugins you want to use. You can specify multiple plugins by separating them with a comma.
- `--database` - The database you want to use. Supported databases include `SQLite`, `PostgreSQL`, and `MySQL`.
- `--package-manager` - The package manager you want to use. Supported package managers are `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun` (defaults to the manager you used to initialize the CLI).
- `--with-auth` - Initialize with Better Auth integration for authentication and authorization.

## Info

The `info` command provides diagnostic information about your Better Query setup and environment. Useful for debugging and sharing when seeking support.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx better-query info
```

### Output

The command displays:
- **System**: OS, CPU, memory, Node.js version
- **Package Manager**: Detected manager and version
- **Better Query**: Version and configuration (sensitive data auto-redacted)
- **Resources**: Defined resources and their schemas
- **Frameworks**: Detected frameworks (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)
- **Databases**: Database clients and ORMs (Prisma, Drizzle, etc.)

### Options

- `--config` - Path to your Better Query config file
- `--json` - Output as JSON for sharing or programmatic use

### Examples

```bash
# Basic usage
npx better-query info

# Custom config path
npx @better-auth/cli@latest info --config ./config/auth.ts

# JSON output
npx @better-auth/cli@latest info --json > auth-info.json
```

Sensitive data like secrets, API keys, and database URLs are automatically replaced with `[REDACTED]` for safe sharing.

## Secret

The CLI also provides a way to generate a secret key for your Better Auth instance.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest secret
```

## Common Issues

**Error: Cannot find module X**

If you see this error, it means the CLI can't resolve imported modules in your Better Auth config file. We are working on a fix for many of these issues, but in the meantime, you can try the following:

- Remove any import aliases in your config file and use relative paths instead. After running the CLI, you can revert to using aliases.
