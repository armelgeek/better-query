description: Integrate Better Query with SQLite.
---

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine that is widely used for local data storage in applications.
Read more [here.](https://www.sqlite.org/)

## Example Usage

Better Query supports multiple SQLite drivers. Choose the one that best fits your environment:

### Better-SQLite3 (Recommended)

The most popular and stable SQLite driver for Node.js:

```ts title="query.ts"
import { betterQuery } from "better-query";
import Database from "better-sqlite3";

export const query = betterQuery({
  database: new Database("database.sqlite"),
});
```

<Callout>
  For more information, read Kysely's documentation to the
  [SqliteDialect](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/SqliteDialect.html).
</Callout>

### Node.js Built-in SQLite (Experimental)

<Callout type="warning">
  The `node:sqlite` module is still experimental and may change at any time. It requires Node.js 22.5.0 or later.
</Callout>

Starting from Node.js 22.5.0, you can use the built-in [SQLite](https://nodejs.org/api/sqlite.html) module:

```ts title="query.ts"
import { betterQuery } from "better-query";
import { DatabaseSync } from "node:sqlite";

export const query = betterQuery({
  database: new DatabaseSync("database.sqlite"),
});
```

To run your application with Node.js SQLite:
```bash
node your-app.js
```

### Bun Built-in SQLite

You can also use the built-in [SQLite](https://bun.com/docs/api/sqlite) module in Bun, which is similar to the Node.js version:

```ts title="query.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-query";
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
export const query = betterAuth({
  database: new Database("database.sqlite"),
});
```

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Query CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Query configuration and plugins.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr className="border-b">
      <th>
        <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">SQLite Schema Generation</p>
      </th>
      <th>
        <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">SQLite Schema Migration</p>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr className="h-10">
      <td>✅ Supported</td>
      <td>✅ Supported</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```bash title="Schema Generation"
npx @better-query/cli@latest generate
```

```bash title="Schema Migration"
npx @better-query/cli@latest migrate
```

## Additional Information

SQLite is supported under the hood via the [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) adapter, any database supported by Kysely would also be supported. (<Link href="/docs/adapters/other-relational-databases">Read more here</Link>)
