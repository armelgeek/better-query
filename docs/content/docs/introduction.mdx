Better Query is a standalone, type-safe CRUD generator built on top of `better-call` that follows the architecture patterns of Better Auth. It provides a powerful way to generate REST API endpoints for your resources with minimal configuration while maintaining full TypeScript support and database agnostic operations.

## Features

Better Query aims to provide the most comprehensive CRUD generation toolkit. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins. Here are some of the key features:

- 🚀 **CLI Generator**: Get started instantly with `npx better-query init --with-auth`
- 🔧 **Automatic Endpoint Generation**: Creates full CRUD endpoints for any resource
- ✅ **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with Zod schema validation
- 🔐 **Better Auth Integration**: Native integration with Better Auth for authentication and authorization
- 🔒 **Granular Permissions**: Configure permissions per operation (create, read, update, delete, list)
- 🛡️ **Role-Based Security**: Define permissions based on user roles and organization membership
- 🔄 **Schema Migrations**: Automated detection and handling of breaking schema changes
- 🎛️ **Configurable**: Enable/disable specific endpoints per resource
- 📊 **Pagination**: Built-in pagination support for list endpoints
- 🔍 **Search**: Basic search functionality for list operations
- 🏗️ **Database Agnostic**: Works with SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL via Kysely
- 🌐 **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any framework that supports Web API handlers
- 🎯 **Type-Safe Client**: Client SDK with full TypeScript support, similar to Better Auth

## AI tooling

### LLMs.txt

Better Auth exposes an `LLMs.txt` that helps AI models understand how to integrate and interact with your authentication system. See it at [https://better-auth.com/llms.txt](https://better-auth.com/llms.txt).

### MCP

Better Auth provides an MCP server so you can use it with any AI model that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
