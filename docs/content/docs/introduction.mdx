Better Kit is a comprehensive TypeScript toolkit for building modern web applications with full type safety. It consists of two powerful packages that work seamlessly together:

## Packages

### Better Query

Better Query is a type-safe CRUD generator built on top of `better-call` that follows the architecture patterns of Better Auth. It provides a powerful way to generate REST API endpoints for your resources with minimal configuration while maintaining full TypeScript support and database agnostic operations.
