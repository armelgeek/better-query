This page contains frequently asked questions, common issues, and other helpful information about Better Query.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Query client not working">
  When encountering `createQueryClient` related errors, make sure to have the correct import path as it varies based on environment.

If you're using the query client on a React front-end, import it from the react entrypoint:

```ts title="component.ts"
import { createQueryClient } from "better-query/react";
```

If you're using the query client in Next.js middleware, server-actions, server-components or anything server-related, import it from the client entrypoint and pass server headers where needed:

```ts title="server.ts"
import { createQueryClient } from "better-query/client";
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Server-side requests and headers">
If you need to perform requests from a server environment (e.g. a Next.js server component) and you must forward incoming request headers, create the query client with fetchOptions that include those headers.

```tsx title="server.tsx"
import { createQueryClient } from "better-query/client";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

const client = createQueryClient({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:3000/api",
  fetchOptions: {
    headers: await headers()
  }
});

const products = await client.product.list();
```

This pattern ensures server-side requests include the same cookies and headers as the incoming request.

<Accordion title="Extending resource schemas">
Better Query provides a type-safe way to extend resource schemas. See the docs on <Link href="/docs/concepts/database#extending-core-schema">extending core schema</Link> for details.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Difference between client hooks and server calls">
Hooks like `useQuery` (client-side) are designed to trigger re-renders and handle caching in the browser. For server-side rendering or one-off server calls, use the query client on the server and pass request headers explicitly.

<Callout type="warn">
  For performance reasons, avoid running client hooks in universal layout files; prefer server-side rendering and server helpers where possible.
</Callout>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Common TypeScript Errors">
If you're facing TypeScript errors, make sure your tsconfig has `strict` set to `true`:
```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
  }
}
```

if you can't set strict to true, you can enable strictNullChecks:
```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true,
  }
}
```

<Accordion title="Can I remove core fields from resource schemas?">
At this time, certain core fields required for correctness (such as unique identifiers and audit timestamps) cannot be removed from resource schemas. We plan to improve schema customizability in the future, but for now keep the core fields in place.
