---

Better Admin is a comprehensive admin panel solution that combines the power of Better Query's backend with an auto-generated admin UI. It provides a complete CRUD interface for your resources with minimal configuration.

## What is Better Admin?

Better Admin is a **headless admin framework** that automatically generates a full-featured admin panel from your Better Query resources. Unlike traditional admin frameworks that lock you into specific UI libraries, Better Admin is framework-agnostic and works with any UI library or framework.

## Key Features

Better Admin provides everything you need to build production-ready admin panels:

- 🚀 **Auto-Generated Admin UI**: Define your resources once with Better Query, get a full admin interface automatically
- 🔐 **Better Auth Integration**: Seamless integration with Better Auth for authentication and permissions
- ✅ **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with automatic type inference from Better Query
- 🎨 **Headless UI**: Framework-agnostic components that work with any UI library (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- 🔧 **Fully Customizable**: Override any component or behavior for specific resources
- 📊 **Rich Features**: Pagination, sorting, filtering, search, bulk operations out of the box
- 🎯 **Permission-Aware**: Respects Better Query permissions for all operations
- 🌐 **Framework Agnostic**: Works with Next.js, Remix, React, Vue, and more

## How It Works

Better Admin builds on top of Better Query's resource definitions:

1. **Define Resources**: Create resources using Better Query with schemas and permissions
2. **Configure Admin**: Add UI metadata to resources (labels, icons, field configurations)
3. **Use Client**: Connect frontend with the admin client and hooks
4. **Customize**: Override default behaviors and UI components as needed

```typescript
// 1. Define resource with Better Query
const product = createResource({
  name: "product",
  schema: productSchema,
  permissions: { /* ... */ }
});

// 2. Add admin configuration
const productAdmin = createAdminResource({
  name: "product",
  label: "Product",
  icon: "📦",
  list: { fields: ["name", "price", "status"] }
});

// 3. Use in your UI
const { data, loading } = useAdminList(adminClient, "product");
```

## Inspiration

Better Admin combines the best aspects of existing solutions:

- **shadcn-admin-kit** (Marmelab) - UI structure and admin patterns
- **Better Query** (armelgeek) - Type-safe CRUD generation and backend
- **React Admin** - Comprehensive admin features

Unlike shadcn-admin-kit which uses ra-core, Better Admin is built on Better Query for a lighter, more flexible solution with full type safety.
